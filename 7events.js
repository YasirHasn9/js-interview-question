// what is the differences between event.preventDefault()
                            //  and   event.stopPropagation()

/*
event.preventDefault() is preventing the default behavior of an element 
if it used in the form , it will prevent it form submitting

event.stopPropagation() stops the propagation of element or stops from 
the bubbling phase
